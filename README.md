# Ophidian CMS
PHP implementation of custom, responsive, lightweight CMS

# Notes:
- Users must be generated via root db insert at this time as there is no need to have a user signup feature
- Currently styled here to specification by client
- Authentication details have been modified here to maintain some obscurity
